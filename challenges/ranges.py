# Experiment with different ranges and slices to get a feel for how they work.
# Remember that you can print the range as well as iterating through it to print
# its values, to check that your ranges are what you expected.
# You may also want to include things like.
#
# o = range(0, 100, 4)
# print(o)
# p = o[::5]
# print(p)
# for i in p:
# 	print(i)

# and see if you can work out what will be printed before running the program. If you are unsure, use a
# for loop to print out the values of o to see why p returns what it does.
